# MY-SECOND-PROJECT
My very first project after i learnt basic Css
I had learnt about;
borders
using margin:0 auto; to centeralize
font-weight, font-stlyes, colors, 
at this point i really understood list items because i had applied to 2 more tutorials on udemy(Hussey and DR Angela) and i was at the introductory stage
this project took longer,i had to learn at a slower pace because i was also attending a IT Support class
